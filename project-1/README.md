In this project, you'll setup your programming environment for the first part of the semester (virtual machine, Docker). You'll practice writing some shell commands to download a zipped file and search (grep) through its contents. You'll automate these steps with a shell script. The shell script may depend on other programs (like unzip), so you'll deploy it as a Docker image with the necessary installs.
